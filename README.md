implemented a comprehensive flight prediction system. Hereâ€™s a summary of I am doing :

Data Collection and Cleaning: Loaded and cleaned the data, and handled missing values.

Data Preprocessing: Extracted and created new features from existing ones.

Data Visualization: Performed EDA to understand the data.

Feature Engineering: Applied feature encoding and selection.

Model Building: Built a RandomForestRegressor model and evaluated it.

Model Saving: Saved the trained model using pickle for future use.

Automation: Created a function to automate model training and evaluation.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to find the best model parameters.
